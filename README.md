# ByteBuddy-A-Simple-NLTK-Chatbot
ByteBuddy is a basic chatbot built using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). 
It interacts with users through a simple command-line interface, responding to various inputs with predefined answers.

## Features
#### Greeting Interaction: 
Recognizes greetings like "hi," "hello," and "hey."
#### General Conversations: 
Responds to common questions like "How are you?" and "What's your name?"
#### Date and Time Retrieval: 
Provides the current date and time on request.
#### Custom Responses: 
Handles general queries and offers help when asked.
#### Graceful Exit:
Allows users to exit the chat with a simple "quit" command.

## How It Works
ByteBuddy uses pattern matching with regular expressions to detect specific phrases in user inputs and responds with predefined messages. 
If it encounters something it doesn't understand, it provides a polite fallback response.

## Customization
You can easily modify the chatbot by updating the patterns list with new phrases and responses to make ByteBuddy more interactive and personalized.
